At minimum you must declare at least two nests and elasticities, one for the elasticity of substitution (input) and one for the elasticity of transformation (output), by convention these are denoted s and t respectively, although any identifier may be used. \n\nAs a minimal example, [s=1, t=0] will set the s nest to have an elasticity of 1 and the t nest 0. Suppose you want a nest below s called va with an elasticity of 2, this is created with [s=1, t=0, va=>s=2]. The va points at its parent nest s and the elasticity follows. Nestings can be aribrarily deep, for example \n\n[s=1, t=0, va=>s=2, dm=>s=1, d=>dm=2]\n\nwill have two nests below s and one below dm. \n\nnetputs\n\nA netput is either an @input or an @output. The netputs get wrapped in a begin ... end block and each netput must be on its own line.\n\nExamples\n\nIn the below example we define the production blocks for two sectors X and Y. This is a non-function example solely created to show syntax. The X sector only has the two require elasticities where as Y has a more interesting nesting structure. A tax is included in the Y production block. \n\njulia> M = MPSGEModel();\n\njulia> @sectors(M, begin\n            X\n            Y\n        end);\n\njulia> @commodities(M, begin\n            PX\n            PY\n            PL\n            PK\n        end);\n\njulia> @consumer(M, RA);\n\njulia> @production(M, X, [s=1,t=0], begin\n            @output(PX, 10, t)\n            @input(PL, 5, s)\n            @input(PK, 5, s)\n        end);\n\njulia> @production(M, Y, [s=2, t=1, va=>s=1], begin\n            @output(PY, 15, t)\n            @input(PX, 3, s)\n            @input(PL, 4, va, taxes = [Tax(RA, .5)])\n            @input(PK, 6, va)\n        end);\n\nFor examples using indexed sectors and commodities we recommend looking at the WiNDC national model. This will be linked when the appropriate write-up is ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"docs/#MPSGE.@sector-Tuple{Any, Any, Vararg{Any, N} where N}","page":"-","title":"MPSGE.@sector","text":"@sector(model, expr, kwargs...)\n\nCreate a sector in the model described by the expr with keyword  arguments kwargs.\n\nsector names\n\nexpr must be one of the forms:\n\nA single symbol like @sector(model, X)\nA container like expression @sector(model, X[I])\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nindex: Explicity sets the index.
