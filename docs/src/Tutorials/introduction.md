# Introduction 

The purpose of these "Getting Started" tutorials is to teach new users the basics of Julia, JuMP, and MPSGE.

## How these tutorials are structured

A high-level overview of the structure of this documentation will assist in finding relevant information.

* The "Getting Started With" tutorials are designed as basic introductions to Julia, JuMP, and MPSGE. If you are new to Julia, JuMP, or MPSGE these are the places to start. For now, the non-MPSGE bullets point to JuMP documentation.
