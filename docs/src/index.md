## What is MPSGE?
MPSGE is a high level language for creating computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. Original implemented in FORTRAN and made available as a subsystem in [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/). The [MPSGE documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html) provided by GAMS is a useful reference, especially for background, theory, and some understanding of the included [features](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html#UG_MPSGE_Intro_KeywordsSyntax).
