## What is MPSGE?
MPSGE is a high level language for creating computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. Original implemented in FORTRAN and made available as a subsystem in [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/). The [MPSGE documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html) provided by GAMS is a useful reference, especially for background, theory, and some understanding of the included [features](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MPSGE_Intro.html#UG_MPSGE_Intro_KeywordsSyntax).

## How the documentation is structured

!!! note
    This documentation is under active development. 

- **Tutorials** contain examples writing CGE models in MPSGE. 
- **Manual**
- **MPSGE Background**
- The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions MPSGE makes available. This is the same information you get in the help entry for individual functions.

## Citing MPSGE
A paper is begin prepared. In the meantime reach out to the authors of the package for information.
